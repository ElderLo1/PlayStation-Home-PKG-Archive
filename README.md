# PlayStation-Home-PKG-Archive
The following repository aims to archive as many PKGs of PlayStation Home as possible, prioritizing original PKGs taken from Sony's servers over modified/repacked PKGs from data on a PS3. However, PKGs may be renamed at times to better suit the current PKG naming convention. Aside from this, no modifications to the PKGs themselves are made.

## Important
PlayStation Home and these PKGs are the property of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. No copyright infringement is intended with this archive, as it's primary purpose is preservation. I am also not affiliated with Destination Home or any other Home preservtion group.
