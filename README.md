# PlayStation-Home-PKG-Archive
The following repository aims to archive as many PKGs of PlayStation Home as possible, prioritizing original PKGs taken from Sony's servers over modified/repacked PKGs.

## Legend
Retail - Retail PKGs are PKGs from the NP server. Pretty much the original client intended for use by the end user. There should be no harm in installing these on a PS3.
QA - QA PKGs are... well, PKGs from the QA server. Clients intended for Sony QA Testers. I wouldn't install it on a PS3 if you value PSN access.
Developer - Developer PKGs are... you get the picture. I wouldn't install it on a PS3 if you value PSN access.

Note: PlayStation Home and these PKGs are the property of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. No copyright infringement is intended with this archive, as it's primary purpose is preservation. I am also not affiliated with Destination Home or any other Home preservtion group.
