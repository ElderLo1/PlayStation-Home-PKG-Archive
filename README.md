# PlayStation-Home-PKG-Archive
The following repository aims to archive as many PKGs of PlayStation Home as possible, prioritizing original PKGs taken from Sony's servers over modified/repacked PKGs from data on a PS3. However, PKGs may be renamed at times to better suit the current PKG naming convention. Aside from this, no modifications to the PKGs themselves are made.

## Why?
This archive was founded so people can easily find whatever PKG of the PlayStation Home client they need, negating the need for big lists of random PSN Zeus links that could go down any time without notice.

## Can I help?
Sure can! If you have the link to a PKG or have a PKG I don't have in the archive, please do open an issue about it and I'll try my hardest to get it in there!

## Important
PlayStation Home and these PKGs are the property of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. No copyright infringement is intended with this archive, as it's primary purpose is preservation. I am also not affiliated with Destination Home or any other Home preservtion group.
